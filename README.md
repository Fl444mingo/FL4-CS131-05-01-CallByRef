Instructor-provided program to introduce the concept of separating main{} into multiple functions that are then called in main, to avoid difficult-to-parse monolithic code and give building blocks to piece together

Learned:
- Separating code into discrete building blocks makes it far more legible and easier to work with
- There are slightly differing ways of handling function calls, alike in result but unlike in the methods under the hood
